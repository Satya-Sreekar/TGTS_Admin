# Verify CORS Status - Testing Instructions

Based on your backend logs showing successful API requests (200 status codes), let's verify if CORS is actually configured correctly.

## Current Status from Logs

✅ **Good news**: Your backend logs show successful API requests:
- `GET /api/media/` → 200 OK
- `GET /api/health` → 200 OK  
- `POST /api/media/upload` → 200 OK

This suggests **requests are reaching the backend**, but we need to verify CORS headers are being returned correctly.

## Quick CORS Test

Run this command from your **production server** (or any machine) to test CORS:

```bash
curl -X GET \
  -H "Origin: https://YOUR-AMPLIFY-DOMAIN.amplifyapp.com" \
  -v https://apitgts.codeology.solutions/api/health \
  2>&1 | grep -i "access-control"
```

### Expected Output (After CORS Fix)

✅ **Good** - Should see:
```
< access-control-allow-origin: https://YOUR-AMPLIFY-DOMAIN.amplifyapp.com
< access-control-allow-credentials: true
```

❌ **Bad** - If you see:
```
< access-control-allow-origin: http://127.0.0.1:5173
```
OR no `access-control-allow-origin` header at all

## Browser-Based Test

1. **Open your Amplify-deployed admin dashboard**

2. **Open Browser DevTools** (F12)

3. **Go to Network tab**

4. **Try any API operation** (view dashboard, load media, etc.)

5. **Check the request details**:
   - Click on an API request
   - Go to "Headers" tab
   - Look for:
     - **Request Headers**: Should have `Origin: https://YOUR-AMPLIFY-DOMAIN.amplifyapp.com`
     - **Response Headers**: Should have `access-control-allow-origin: https://YOUR-AMPLIFY-DOMAIN.amplifyapp.com`

### If You See CORS Errors in Console

Even though backend logs show 200, browser might still show CORS errors if:
- CORS headers are missing
- CORS headers don't match the origin
- Preflight OPTIONS request fails

## Verify Backend Code is Updated

SSH into your production server and check:

```bash
# Check if CORS code includes amplifyapp.com
grep -A 5 "amplifyapp.com" /path/to/backend/app/__init__.py

# Should output something like:
# allowed_origins = default_origins + [re.compile(r'https://.*\.amplifyapp\.com')]
```

## Next Steps Based on Results

### If CORS Headers Are Correct ✅
- Your CORS is working!
- The "Backend server is not reachable" error might be:
  - A different issue (network timeout, SSL, etc.)
  - An intermittent problem
  - Cached error in browser (try hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R)

### If CORS Headers Are Missing/Incorrect ❌
- The backend code hasn't been deployed yet
- Follow deployment steps in `URGENT_FIX_BACKEND_DEPLOYMENT.md`

## Additional Debugging

If requests succeed in logs but fail in browser:

1. **Check browser console** for specific error messages:
   - Network Error → Connection issue
   - CORS policy → CORS configuration issue
   - 401/403 → Authentication issue

2. **Check Network tab timing**:
   - If request shows "CORS preflight" or "OPTIONS" request failing
   - Preflight requests fail silently in some cases

3. **Test from browser console**:
   ```javascript
   fetch('https://apitgts.codeology.solutions/api/health', {
     headers: { 'Origin': window.location.origin }
   })
   .then(r => r.json())
   .then(console.log)
   .catch(console.error)
   ```

## Summary

Your logs show the backend is **receiving and processing requests successfully**. This is a good sign! Now we just need to verify:
1. ✅ CORS headers are being returned correctly
2. ✅ CORS headers match your Amplify domain
3. ✅ Browser is accepting the CORS response

If CORS headers are correct, the issue might be resolved or there might be a different underlying problem.
