# ✅ Production CORS Configuration Fix

## Problem Identified

The admin dashboard was showing **network errors** when deployed to AWS Amplify because:

1. ❌ **CORS Configuration Issue**: The backend API at `https://apitgts.codeology.solutions` was only configured to allow requests from:
   - `http://localhost:5173`
   - `http://localhost:5174`
   - `http://127.0.0.1:5173`
   - `http://127.0.0.1:5174`

2. ❌ **Deployed Domain Not Allowed**: When deployed to AWS Amplify, the admin dashboard runs on a domain like:
   - `https://main.xxxxx.amplifyapp.com`
   
   This domain was **NOT** in the allowed CORS origins, causing all API requests to fail with CORS errors.

## Fix Applied

Updated the backend CORS configuration in `flask_backend/app/__init__.py` to:

1. ✅ **Read CORS origins from environment variable** (`CORS_ORIGINS`) for flexible configuration
2. ✅ **Allow all AWS Amplify domains** by default using regex pattern: `https://.*\.amplifyapp\.com`
3. ✅ **Maintain localhost support** for local development
4. ✅ **Support explicit domain configuration** via environment variable

### Changes Made

**File**: `flask_backend/app/__init__.py`

- Added support for `CORS_ORIGINS` environment variable
- Added regex pattern to allow all `*.amplifyapp.com` domains
- Maintained backward compatibility with localhost origins

## Verification

✅ **Backend API is accessible**:
```bash
curl https://apitgts.codeology.solutions/api/health
# Returns: {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"...","version":"1.0.0"}
```

✅ **Frontend API Configuration is correct**:
- Admin frontend is configured to use: `https://apitgts.codeology.solutions/api`
- This is set in `Admin Frontend/src/services/api.ts`

## Next Steps - Deploy Updated Backend

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: The CORS fix has been applied to the code, but you need to **deploy the updated backend** to production for it to take effect.

### Option 1: If using environment variable (Recommended)

1. **Update production `.env` file** on your server:
   ```bash
   CORS_ORIGINS=https://main.xxxxx.amplifyapp.com,https://your-custom-domain.com
   ```

2. **Restart the backend server**

### Option 2: Auto-allow Amplify domains (Already implemented)

If you **don't set** `CORS_ORIGINS`, the code will automatically allow:
- All localhost origins (for development)
- All `*.amplifyapp.com` domains (for AWS Amplify deployments)

Just **redeploy the backend** and it should work!

## Testing After Deployment

1. **Deploy the updated backend code** to `https://apitgts.codeology.solutions`

2. **Test from deployed admin dashboard**:
   - Open your Amplify-deployed admin dashboard
   - Open browser DevTools (F12) → Network tab
   - Try any API operation (e.g., view dashboard, upload media)
   - Should see successful API requests without CORS errors

3. **Check browser console**:
   - Should see: `API Base URL: https://apitgts.codeology.solutions/api`
   - No CORS errors in console

## Configuration Options

### For Production (Recommended)

Set `CORS_ORIGINS` environment variable on production server:
```bash
CORS_ORIGINS=https://main.xxxxx.amplifyapp.com,https://admin.yourdomain.com
```

### For Development

No changes needed - localhost origins are included by default.

### Auto-Detect (Current Default)

If `CORS_ORIGINS` is not set:
- ✅ Allows localhost (for local dev)
- ✅ Allows all `*.amplifyapp.com` domains (for Amplify)
- ⚠️ Allows any Amplify domain automatically

## Troubleshooting

### Still seeing CORS errors?

1. **Verify backend is updated**:
   ```bash
   # Check if updated code is deployed
   grep -r "amplifyapp.com" /path/to/production/backend/app/__init__.py
   ```

2. **Check backend logs** for CORS errors:
   - Look for errors about origin not allowed

3. **Test CORS directly**:
   ```bash
   curl -X OPTIONS \
     -H "Origin: https://main.xxxxx.amplifyapp.com" \
     -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET" \
     -I https://apitgts.codeology.solutions/api/health
   ```
   Should return `access-control-allow-origin` header

4. **Check environment variable**:
   - Ensure `CORS_ORIGINS` is set correctly if using explicit configuration
   - Or ensure it's NOT set to use auto-detection for Amplify

## Summary

✅ **Problem**: CORS configuration blocked Amplify-deployed admin dashboard  
✅ **Solution**: Updated CORS to allow Amplify domains automatically  
✅ **Action Required**: Deploy updated backend code to production  
✅ **Testing**: Verify API works from deployed admin dashboard

The fix is complete in the code - just needs to be deployed to production!
